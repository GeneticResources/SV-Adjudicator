00. Preprocessing
=================

The zeroth module of the pipeline is the preprocessing module. The
preprocessing module is of necessity designed for our specific use cases,
and is not intended to be as portable and reusable as the other modules. We
provide the module here for internal Talkowski laboratory use and to serve as
an example for how to produce the files required by the remainder of the
pipeline.
